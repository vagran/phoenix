====== Third parties software ======

Phoenix project uses third parties open source software to avoid additional effort for existing solutions recreating. However general policy allows to use 3rd parties code only when absolutely necessary. The reason is that most of open source solutions are written in C and not well-fit to Phoenix code base. For now the general approach is to mostly preserve original library code, make all its external interfaces portable (not dependent on POSIX or any other environment) and wrap it completely to C++ classes which can be used by the rest of the system code.

There is a subset of header files which can be included by 3rd parties C code:
  * defs.h - Common system definitions.
  * types.h - Common system types.
  * compat_types.h - Compatibility types created specially for 3rd parties software which requires some UNIX/POSIX types.

===== List =====

  * [[athena:product:phoenix:components:libelf|libelf]] is used in many components which requires ELF files parsing.
  * GNU-EFI project code base utilized for [[athena:product:phoenix:components:efi_loader|EFI boot loader]] implementation.
